This can be thought of as plane-to-plane, but, as its name suggests it can be extended to account for other types of approximations. On the original publication it's shown that both  [Point-to-plane ICP](../pipelines/icp_registration.ipynb#Point-to-plane-ICP) and [Point-to-point ICP](../pipelines/icp_registration.ipynb#Point-to-point-ICP) are special cases of the Generalized-icp framework."
